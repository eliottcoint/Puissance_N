# Puissance N

## Overview
**Puissance N** is an enhanced version of the classic Connect 4 game, implemented in Python. The game allows for a customizable grid size and the number of consecutive discs required to win, making it a more flexible and challenging version of the traditional game. This project was developed as part of an academic assignment.

## Features
- **Customizable Grid Size:** Players can define the size of the grid, allowing for a variety of gameplay experiences.
- **Customizable Win Condition:** The game allows players to set the number of consecutive discs required to win (N), making the game more challenging and adaptable.
- **Multiplayer Mode:** Two players can compete against each other, alternating turns to place their discs on the grid.
- **Interactive Command-Line Interface:** The game runs in the terminal, with a user-friendly interface for placing discs and checking the game state.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core programming language used to develop the game.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Simple text-based interface for interacting with the game.
